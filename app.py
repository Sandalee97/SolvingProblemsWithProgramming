"""
Demo app placeholder - the repository contains two Flask apps. The full
document-tracker lives under the `application/` folder. To run the
cupboard/drawer document tracker UI (login, dashboard, search) run:

    python .\application\app.py

This top-level module is intentionally left as a placeholder to avoid
accidentally running the demo app.
